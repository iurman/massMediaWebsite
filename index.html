        <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p class = "ethical-introduction">There are many ethical questions that arise with the growth of streaming services. Topics include the fairness of compensation to creators, the handling of user data, and the societal impacts of algorithm-driven content recommendations. We'll explore how companies and regulators are addressing these concerns and the ongoing debate over the ethical responsibilities of streaming platforms.        </p>
        <div class="ethical-considerations-container">
            <h3>Fair Compensation for Creators</h3>

            <p>Understanding the debate between pro-rata and user-centric payment models and their impact on creators.</p>
            <img src="img/faircomp.jpg" alt="Fair Compensation Visual">
            <p>The debate over how music streaming services pay artists is significant, with discussions centered around pro-rata and user-centric payment models. Pro-rata payments distribute earnings based on an artist's share of total streams, potentially favoring popular artists over niche ones. User-centric payments allocate a listener's subscription fee to the artists they listen to, which might support a fairer distribution of income. This complex issue involves balancing the interests of artists, platforms, and listeners to ensure creators are fairly compensated for their work.</p>

            <h3>Transparency and User Data</h3>
            
            <p>Exploring how user data shapes the music industry and the importance of transparency in streaming services.</p>
            <img src="img/userprivacy.jpg" alt="Data Transparency Visual">
            <p>The European Union is considering reforms to increase transparency in the music streaming industry. These include making clear how revenue is allocated, disclosing the use of artificial intelligence in creating music, and ensuring recommendation algorithms do not unfairly favor certain artists or labels. Such measures aim to protect artists and ensure consumers understand how their data and preferences influence what they are recommended.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ethical-considerations-container">
            <h3>Societal Impact of Algorithm-Driven Recommendations</h3>
            
            <p>Examining how algorithms influence what we listen to and their broader cultural implications.</p>
            <img src="img/algorithm.jpeg" alt="Algorithm Impact Visual">
            <p>Streaming platforms' reliance on algorithms to recommend content to users can significantly impact what music gets heard and by whom. Concerns arise about whether these algorithms promote a diverse range of artists or reinforce the popularity of already successful ones. The EU's proposed reforms also address this, suggesting a need for algorithms that promote cultural diversity and prevent the domination of content from large record labels.</p>
